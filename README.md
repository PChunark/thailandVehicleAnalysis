# Thailand Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) Analysis
Thailand committed to its ambitious national climate target at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in 2021. It launched the first-ever long-term low GHG emission development strategy (LT-LEDS). 
It would meet carbon neutrality by 2050 and achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2065. In COP27, the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is updated to align with the commitment in COP26. 
The revised LT-LEDS has been submitted. 

As of September 2023, the updated National Energy Policy (NEP) is being formulated. The plan combines a power development plan (PDP), an alternative energy development plan (AEDP), a gas plan, an oil plan and an
energy efficiency plan (EEP). The plan would be completed in the 4th quarter of 2023. The plan contains key policies in achieving its carbon neutrality. In the transport sector, the "30@30" policy is a key policy
to minimize emissions in road transport by raising national battery electric vehicle production and usage. The sale of BEV would account for 30% of total vehicle sales by 2030. The sale mainly focuses on sedans and
motorcycles. 

## Objectives
* To collect current BEV
* To compare the current BEV situation with the forecasted value
* To analyze gaps between the current BEV situation and the forecasted value

## Scopes
* The data is obtained from [Statistic Division, Department of Land Transport](https://web.dlt.go.th/statistics/).
* The cumulative registered vehicle is used.
* The R code and Rstudio are used.
* Air, maritime and rail transports are excluded from the analysis.
